<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Abstract</div>
<p>The ER's helix 12 domain plays a crucial role in determining interactions with coactivators and corepressors and, therefore, the respective agonist or antagonist effect of the ligand. Different ligands may differ in their affinity for alpha and beta isoforms of the estrogen receptor: * 17-beta-estradiol binds equally well to both receptors * estrone bind preferentially to the alpha receptor * estriol, raloxifene, and genistein to the beta receptor Subtype selective estrogen receptor modulators preferentially bind to either the α- or the β-subtype of the receptor. In addition, the different estrogen receptor combinations may respond differently to various ligands, which may translate into tissue selective agonistic and antagonistic effects.[13] The ratio of α- to β- subtype concentration has been proposed to play a role in certain diseases. The concept of selective estrogen receptor modulators is based on the ability to promote ER interactions with different proteins such as transcriptional coactivator or corepressors. Furthermore, the ratio of coactivator to corepressor protein varies in different tissues.[15] As a consequence, the same ligand may be an agonist in some tissue (where coactivators predominate) while antagonistic in other tissues (where corepressors dominate). Tamoxifen, for example, is an antagonist in breast and is, therefore, used as a breast cancer treatment[16] but an ER agonist in bone (thereby preventing osteoporosis) and a partial agonist in the endometrium (increasing the risk of uterine cancer).</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Abstract</div>
<p>Provide a concise and informative summation of the AOP under development that can stand-alone from the AOP page. Abstracts should typically be 200-400 words in length (similar to an abstract for a journal article). Suggested content for the abstract includes the following: (1) the background/purpose for initiation of the AOP’s development (if there was a specific intent); (2) a brief description of the MIE, AO, and/or major KEs that define the pathway; (3) a short summation of the overall weight of evidence supporting the AOP and identification of major knowledge gaps (if any); (4) a brief statement about how the AOP may be applied. The aim is to capture the highlights of the AOP and its potential scientific and regulatory relevance.</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Background</div>
<p>During normal mitochondria function an H-ion gradient is formed across the inner mitochondrial membrane as a result of metabolically mediated electron transport and the H-ions are used to generate ATP via the ATP-synthetase enzyme complex, which is membrane bound.  The movement of electrons down the mitochondrial respiratory chain is coupled to the proton pumping, which builds a large proton motive force (membrane potential) across the mitochondrial inner membrane.  The energy transduced by the membrane potential is used for the synthesis of ATP.</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>The ionized uncoupler short-circuits the H-ion gradient and provides an alternative process of transporting the H-ions across the membrane (Blaikie et al., 2006).  Respiration continues to pump H-ions across the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix but no ion gradient is formed because the weak acids dissipate the ions and no ATP is synthesized.  The result is that uncoupling chemicals induce a metabolically futile wasting of energy by stimulating resting respiration, while at the same time decreasing ATP yield (Wallace and Starkov, 2000).  Molecularly and physiologically, the best studied, weak acid respiratory uncouplers compounds are 2,4-dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol (Loomis and Lippmann, 1948; McLaughlin and Dilger, 1980; McKim et al., 1987).</p>

<span class="imgEffect_DownstreamEffect" title="Downstream Effect"></span>Reduced ATP formation</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>In normally functioning mitochondria, the energy released from NADH oxidation is used to pump protons from the matrix of the mitochondria to the intermembrane space, thereby creating an electrochemical gradient which is used by ATP synthase (complex V) as the energy source for ATP production.

Xenobiotics may cause reduced mitochondrial ATP formation via interaction with a variety of mitochondrial targets including inhibition of individual complexes of the electron transport chain and inhibition of ATP synthase.

ATP levels are often measured at a cellular level using luciferin-luciferase based assays.  These assays involve the measurement of light produced by the reaction of ATP with added luciferase and D-luciferin.  Within certain limits, the light emitted is proportional to the ATP concentration.</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Cells which are unable to sufficiently compensate for a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation by increasing glycolysis, will suffer a significant drop in cellular ATP level following electron transport chain inhibition.  In these cells, there will likely be a subsequent inhibition of ATP-dependent cellular functions.  Many of these functions are crucial for cell function and survival.  For instance, severe energy depletion may cause failure of the ATP-driven calcium and sodium pumps.  This in turn can result in flooding of the cell with calcium and sodium, leading to osmotic rupture of the plasma membrane [Boelsterli].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Abstract</div>
<p>McKim et al. (1997) used fish acute toxicity syndromes based on biochemical and/or physiological effects of exposure, selected as key responses measured in vivo from exposure to model chemicals.  One syndrome they developed was for weak acid uncouplers based on 2,4-dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol (McKim et al., 1997) that is different than either the syndrome for nonpolar narcosis or polar narcosis.  The physiological-biochemical responses in spinally transected rainbow trout upon exposure to these two model weak acid uncoupler is a rapid and continuous increase in ventilation volume and O2 consumption, which corresponds to an increase in the rate of metabolism.  These whole fish observations are consistent with the hypothesis of futile metabolism where ventilation increases in an effort to provide more oxygen, which is utilized in respiration, but without the production of ATP.  Ten phenolic uncouplers have been tested in the fathead minnow 96-hr flow-through acute toxicity assay (Russom et al., 1997).</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Background</div>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium channels (VSGCs) are protein structures common to vertebrate and invertebrate species.  They are composed of multiple subunits (alpha and beta subunits in mammals). The alpha subunit forms a pore through neuronal membranes and controls sodium flux across the neuronal membrane. The beta subunits influence the function and expression of the alpha subunits. Opening of the VGSC increases sodium entry into the neuron and is responsible for generating the action potential (movement of an electrical signal along the neuron that represents a change in membrane excitability). There are a number of VSGC subtypes, and there is evidence that channel subtypes differ in sensitivity to different toxicants.</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Toxicants interact with voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) to alter the normal flux of sodium ions across the neuronal cell membrane by prolonging (slowing) the kinetics of VGSC activation (opening) and inactivation (closing);</p>

<p>Provide a concise and informative summation of the AOP under development that can stand-alone from the AOP page. Abstracts should typically be 200-400 words in length (similar to an abstract for a journal article). Suggested content for the abstract includes the following: (1) the background/purpose for initiation of the AOP’s development (if there was a specific intent); (2) a brief description of the MIE, AO, and/or major KEs that define the pathway; (3) a short summation of the overall weight of evidence supporting the AOP and identification of major knowledge gaps (if any); (4) a brief statement about how the AOP may be applied. The aim is to capture the highlights of the AOP and its potential scientific and regulatory relevance.</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Abstract</div>
<p>The ER's helix 12 domain plays a crucial role in determining interactions with coactivators and corepressors and, therefore, the respective agonist or antagonist effect of the ligand. Different ligands may differ in their affinity for alpha and beta isoforms of the estrogen receptor: * 17-beta-estradiol binds equally well to both receptors * estrone bind preferentially to the alpha receptor * estriol, raloxifene, and genistein to the beta receptor Subtype selective estrogen receptor modulators preferentially bind to either the α- or the β-subtype of the receptor. In addition, the different estrogen receptor combinations may respond differently to various ligands, which may translate into tissue selective agonistic and antagonistic effects.[13] The ratio of α- to β- subtype concentration has been proposed to play a role in certain diseases. The concept of selective estrogen receptor modulators is based on the ability to promote ER interactions with different proteins such as transcriptional coactivator or corepressors. Furthermore, the ratio of coactivator to corepressor protein varies in different tissues.[15] As a consequence, the same ligand may be an agonist in some tissue (where coactivators predominate) while antagonistic in other tissues (where corepressors dominate). Tamoxifen, for example, is an antagonist in breast and is, therefore, used as a breast cancer treatment[16] but an ER agonist in bone (thereby preventing osteoporosis) and a partial agonist in the endometrium (increasing the risk of uterine cancer).</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Background</div>
<p>The electron transport chain (ETC) is composed of four complexes (I-IV) embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays a crucial role in the production of ATP by mitochondria.  Electrons are received from a donor such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and then dropped through a series of intermediate stages of increasing redox potential to their final destination, oxygen.  The energy released from NADH oxidation is used to pump protons from the matrix of the mitochondria to the intermembrane space, thereby creating an electrochemical gradient which is used by ATP synthase as the energy source for ATP production.

Complex I, also known as NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, is the first of the four complexes of the ETC.  The complex receives 2 electrons from NADH and passes each electron along a chain of Fe-S clusters where they are ultimately delivered, via terminal cluster N2, to ubiquinone which is reduced to ubiquinol.  For each electron pair donated to ubiquinone, complex I pumps 4 protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space [Scheffler].</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>A large number of structurally diverse compounds of synthetic and natural origin are known to inhibit the activity of complex I [Esposti].  Rotenone is perhaps the best known of these, although other well-known inhibitors include the antibiotic piericidin A and N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) which is the active metabolite of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.

The mechanism of complex I inhibition is not well understood.  It appears that the vast majority of known inhibitors, including rotenone, act at the ubiquinone reduction site, preventing the transfer of electrons from the terminal Fe-S cluster, N2, to ubiquinone [Scheffler].  However, many authors believe that complex I has multiple ubiquinone reduction sites and as a result may present multiple sites for inhibitors [Gluck et al].  This may, in part, explain the structural diversity of compounds capable of inhibiting the complex.</p>

<span class="imgEffect_DownstreamEffect" title="Downstream Effect"></span>Reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>In normally functioning mitochondria, electrons are carried along the electron transport chain (ETC) from a donor, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, to oxygen which is reduced to water.  This process results in the consumption of oxygen by mitochondria.

The inhibition of electron flow along the ETC prevents the conversion of oxygen to water, resulting in reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption.  Xenobiotics may impair electron flow via multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of individual complexes of the ETC and inhibition of ATP synthase leading to fixed or hyperpolarized membrane potential.

Oxygen consumption can be measured in isolated mitochondria or whole cells.  Traditionally, this was achieved using the Clarke electrode; however, alternative methods have now been developed.  One approach is to use a conjugated Pt-porphyrin probe with long-decay phosphorescence which is quenched by molecular oxygen [Hynes et al].  It is important to note that while a reduction in oxygen consumption in isolated mitochondria is indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, this is not the case in whole cells since a dying cell will display a reduction in oxygen uptake regardless of mechanism.  To overcome this problem, pH sensors can be used to measure extracellular acidification.  Glycolysis is known to increase following mitochondrial impairment, thereby increasing the acidification rate, an effect not seen with general cytotoxicity.</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>In normally functioning mitochondria, the energy released as electrons flow through the electron transport chain (ETC) is used to pump protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space, thereby maintaining the electrochemical gradient.

The interaction of xenobiotics with mitochondrial targets may lead to reduced membrane potential via a variety of mechanisms.  These include inhibition of the individual complexes of the ETC and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.

Mitochondrial membrane potential is usually measured in vitro using fluorescent cationic dyes which accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix as a function of the Nernst equation.  Examples of dyes used include JC-1, rhodamine 123, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester and MitoTracker Red [Nadanaciva and Will].</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Mitochondria are believed to be a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under normal physiological conditions.  It is thought that ROS generation is localized to complexes I and III, via electron leakage.  ‘Leaked’ electrons may react with molecular oxygen, which undergoes a one-electron reduction to yield superoxide [Turrens].

Xenobiotics may cause an increase in ROS formation via interaction with several mitochondrial targets including inhibition of individual complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC) and inhibition of ATP synthase.

ROS are usually measured in vitro using compounds such as dichlorofluorescin or dihydroethidium bromide, which yield a fluorescent signal upon oxidation.</p>

ATP levels are often measured at a cellular level using luciferin-luciferase based assays.  These assays involve the measurement of light produced by the reaction of ATP with added luciferase and D-luciferin.  Within certain limits, the light emitted is proportional to the ATP concentration.</p>

<p>Apoptosis is the most common and best understood form of programmed cell death.  Cells undergoing apoptotic death display characteristic morphological changes, including blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation and chromosomal DNA fragmentation.  Xenobiotic-induced apoptosis may be triggered by a wide variety of stimuli.  Among these, excessive oxidative stress and its downstream signalling cascades are believed to be a critical initiator of apoptotic death [Boelsterli].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Cells which are unable to sufficiently compensate for a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation by increasing glycolysis, will suffer a significant drop in cellular ATP level following electron transport chain inhibition.  In these cells, there will likely be a subsequent inhibition of ATP-dependent cellular functions.  Many of these functions are crucial for cell function and survival.  For instance, severe energy depletion may cause failure of the ATP-driven calcium and sodium pumps.  This in turn can result in flooding of the cell with calcium and sodium, leading to osmotic rupture of the plasma membrane [Boelsterli].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Abstract</div>
<p>McKim et al. (1997) used fish acute toxicity syndromes based on biochemical and/or physiological effects of exposure, selected as key responses measured in vivo from exposure to model chemicals.  One syndrome they developed was for weak acid uncouplers based on 2,4-dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol (McKim et al., 1997) that is different than either the syndrome for nonpolar narcosis or polar narcosis.  The physiological-biochemical responses in spinally transected rainbow trout upon exposure to these two model weak acid uncoupler is a rapid and continuous increase in ventilation volume and O2 consumption, which corresponds to an increase in the rate of metabolism.  These whole fish observations are consistent with the hypothesis of futile metabolism where ventilation increases in an effort to provide more oxygen, which is utilized in respiration, but without the production of ATP.  Ten phenolic uncouplers have been tested in the fathead minnow 96-hr flow-through acute toxicity assay (Russom et al., 1997).</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Background</div>
<p>The electron transport chain (ETC) is composed of four complexes (I-IV) embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays a crucial role in the production of ATP by mitochondria.  Electrons are received from a donor such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and then dropped through a series of intermediate stages of increasing redox potential to their final destination, oxygen.  The energy released from NADH oxidation is used to pump protons from the matrix of the mitochondria to the intermembrane space, thereby creating an electrochemical gradient which is used by ATP synthase as the energy source for ATP production.

Complex II, more commonly referred to as succinate:ubiquinone reductase (SQR), plays a role in both the ETC and the Krebs cycle.  It is responsible for the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol.  Structurally, SQR is the simplest of the complexes of the ETC, consisting of only four subunits [Scheffler].  These are a flavoprotein, an iron-sulfur protein (containing the 3 centres: [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S]) and two small membrane anchor subunits.  The complex contributes to electron flow to oxygen but is not directly involved in proton translocation.</p>

<p>Xenobiotic-induced inhibition of complex II is not well understood and may proceed via multiple mechanisms involving different sites within the complex.  Inhibitors of complex II can be broadly divided into two classes: those that bind in the succinate pocket and those which bind in the ubiquinone pocket.  The former class includes various dicarboxylic acids and analogues.  Examples include oxaloacetate [Wojtovich et al], fluorinated analogues of succinate and fumarate such as 2-fluorosuccinate and difluorofumarate [Tober et al], as well as the nitro-analogue of malonate, 3-nitro propionic acid (3-NPA) [Sun et al].  Examples of ubiquinone type inhibitors include carboxin, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) and various atpenins, such as harzianopyridone [Miyadera et al].</p>

Complex III, also known as ubiquinone-cytochrome c oxidoreductase or the bc1 complex, is a homodimeric and multi-subunit protein.  Three subunits form the functional core of the enzyme and these contain prosthetic groups which are responsible for the catalytic activity.  The cytochrome b subunit has two b-type hemes (bL and bH), the cytochrome c subunit has one c-type heme (c1) and the Reiske subunit contains a 2Fe-2S cluster.  Overall, the complex catalyses the oxidation of ubiquinol to ubiquinone and the reduction of cytochrome c3+ to cytochrome c2+.  In the process, 4 protons are pumped to the intermembrane space [Scheffler].</p>

Complex IV, commonly referred to as cytochrome c oxidase, is the fourth and terminal complex of the ETC.  The mammalian complex functions as a dimer, with each monomer unit containing 13 different polypeptide chains.  Three subunits form the functional core of the enzyme and these contain two hemes (heme a and heme a3) and two copper centres (the CuA and CuB centres).  The role of the complex within the ETC is to receive four electrons from cytochrome c and pass them, via the copper and heme centres, to oxygen, which is reduced to water.  The energy released by this process is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space.  For every oxygen molecule that is reduced, two molecules of water are produced and four protons are pumped to the intermembrane space [Scheffler].</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Background</div>
<p>Complex V, commonly referred to as ATP synthase, is a multisubunit protein located within the mitochondria and responsible for the majority of ATP synthesis in aerobic cells.  The enzyme is reversible and may also hydrolyse ATP to produce ADP and generate a proton gradient.  The complex consists of two structurally and functionally distinct regions: the hydrophobic FO region, embedded within the mitochondrial membrane, and the hydrophilic F1 portion which protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix.

ATP synthase produces ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.  The reaction is energetically unfavourable, a problem which ATP synthase overcomes by harnessing the energy produced by the electron transport chain (ETC) and stored in the form of the mitochondrial membrane potential.  During electron transport, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane of the mitochondria.  The FO portion of ATP synthase is embedded in the inner membrane and provides a narrow hydrophilic channel through which protons can pass.  When protons travel through ATP synthase, from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix, driven by the electrochemical gradient, their movement causes FO and its axle to rotate .  The rotation of the axle induces conformational changes in proteins of the F1 portion.  The energy released due to these conformational changes is used to drive the energetically unfavourable formation of ATP.</p>

<p>A wide variety of structurally diverse compounds are known to inhibit the activity of ATP synthase.  Inhibitors may be broadly divided into two categories: those which act at the FO portion, such as oligomycin [Glaser et al] and N-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpeperidyl-1-oxyl)-N-(cyclohexyl)carbo-diimide (NCCD) [Azzi et al], and those which act at the F1 portion, such as azide [Bald et al] and quinacrine mustard [Laikind and Allison].  It should be noted, however, that many inhibitors have multiple binding sites, and may inhibit both the FO and F1 portions.  An example is dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) which binds covalently to both FO- and F1-sites [Hong and Pederson].</p>

Xenobiotics may cause reduced mitochondrial ATP formation via interaction with a variety of mitochondrial targets including inhibition of individual complexes of the electron transport chain and inhibition of ATP synthase.

ATP levels are often measured at a cellular level using luciferin-luciferase based assays.  These assays involve the measurement of light produced by the reaction of ATP with added luciferase and D-luciferin.  Within certain limits, the light emitted is proportional to the ATP concentration.</p>

<span class="imgEffect_DownstreamEffect" title="Downstream Effect"></span>Hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>The inhibition of ATP synthase prevents dissipation of the proton gradient.  As a result, the electron transport chain is also impaired, since the energy released via oxidation of substrates and electron flow is not sufficient to pump more protons against the steep electrochemical gradient.  Consequently, mitochondrial membrane potential is either maintained or hyperpolarized immediately following inhibition of ATP synthase.

Treatment of a variety of cell types with oligomycin has been shown to have either no effect on mitochondrial membrane potential or to lead to hyperpolarization.  For instance, in a study using cultured hepatocytes, treatment with 1 μg/mL oligomycin had no impact on mitochondrial membrane potential until the very onset of cell death [Nieminen et al].  Likewise, no change in membrane potential was observed following treatment of FL5.12 cells with 15 μM oligomycin [Marton et al].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Cells which are unable to sufficiently compensate for a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation by increasing glycolysis, will suffer a significant drop in cellular ATP level following electron transport chain inhibition.  In these cells, there will likely be a subsequent inhibition of ATP-dependent cellular functions.  Many of these functions are crucial for cell function and survival.  For instance, severe energy depletion may cause failure of the ATP-driven calcium and sodium pumps.  This in turn can result in flooding of the cell with calcium and sodium, leading to osmotic rupture of the plasma membrane [Boelsterli].</p>

<span class="imgEffect_DownstreamEffect" title="Downstream Effect"></span>Reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>In normally functioning mitochondria, electrons are carried along the electron transport chain (ETC) from a donor, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, to oxygen which is reduced to water.  This process results in the consumption of oxygen by mitochondria.

The inhibition of electron flow along the ETC prevents the conversion of oxygen to water, resulting in reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption.  Xenobiotics may impair electron flow via multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of individual complexes of the ETC and inhibition of ATP synthase leading to fixed or hyperpolarized membrane potential.

Oxygen consumption can be measured in isolated mitochondria or whole cells.  Traditionally, this was achieved using the Clarke electrode; however, alternative methods have now been developed.  One approach is to use a conjugated Pt-porphyrin probe with long-decay phosphorescence which is quenched by molecular oxygen [Hynes et al].  It is important to note that while a reduction in oxygen consumption in isolated mitochondria is indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, this is not the case in whole cells since a dying cell will display a reduction in oxygen uptake regardless of mechanism.  To overcome this problem, pH sensors can be used to measure extracellular acidification.  Glycolysis is known to increase following mitochondrial impairment, thereby increasing the acidification rate, an effect not seen with general cytotoxicity.</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Mitochondria are believed to be a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under normal physiological conditions.  It is thought that ROS generation is localized to complexes I and III, via electron leakage.  ‘Leaked’ electrons may react with molecular oxygen, which undergoes a one-electron reduction to yield superoxide [Turrens].

Xenobiotics may cause an increase in ROS formation via interaction with several mitochondrial targets including inhibition of individual complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC) and inhibition of ATP synthase.

ROS are usually measured in vitro using compounds such as dichlorofluorescin or dihydroethidium bromide, which yield a fluorescent signal upon oxidation.</p>

<p>McKim et al. (1997) used fish acute toxicity syndromes based on biochemical and/or physiological effects of exposure, selected as key responses measured in vivo from exposure to model chemicals.  One syndrome they developed was for weak acid uncouplers based on 2,4-dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol (McKim et al., 1997) that is different than either the syndrome for nonpolar narcosis or polar narcosis.  The physiological-biochemical responses in spinally transected rainbow trout upon exposure to these two model weak acid uncoupler is a rapid and continuous increase in ventilation volume and O2 consumption, which corresponds to an increase in the rate of metabolism.  These whole fish observations are consistent with the hypothesis of futile metabolism where ventilation increases in an effort to provide more oxygen, which is utilized in respiration, but without the production of ATP.  Ten phenolic uncouplers have been tested in the fathead minnow 96-hr flow-through acute toxicity assay (Russom et al., 1997).</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Substrates for 5-alpha reductases are 3-keto, delta 4,5 C19/C21 steroids. The group '3-keto' refers to the oxygen-carbon double bond at carbon 3. 'Delta 4,5' refers to the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. The reaction involves a stereoselective and irreversible break of the double bond between C4 and C5 with the aid of the NADPH cofactor and the insertion of a hydride anion to the alpha face in C5 and a proton to the beta face in C4 and leads to the formation of the product that leaves the enzyme-NADP+ complex. The NADP+ departs last and the enzyme becomes free for further catalytic cycles. The reaction is the following: Substrate + NADPH + H+ = 5-alpha-substrate + NADP+. Inhibitors can be classified in three types: 1) competitive with the cofactor (NADPH) and substrate where the inhibitor binds the free enzyme, 2) competitive with the substrate where the inhibitor binds the enzyme-NADPH complex (e.g. 4-6-10 azasteroids) and 3) uncompetitive with the enzyme-NADP+ complex where the inhibitor binds the complex after the product leaves. Finasteride is competitive with the substrate. The 5-alpha reductase type 2 shows a narrow acidic pH optimum (pH 5.0 - 5.5) but in human intact cells it appears that this enzyme functions at a more neutral pH range (6.0-7.0). The affinity for testosterone is shown by Km = 0.004 - 1 µM [Azzouni et al].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family, which also consists of mineral corticoid, glucocorticoid, oestrogen and progesterone receptors [Helsen et al]. These receptors are classified as class I receptors of the nuclear receptors ‘super family’ which includes thyroid hormones, retinoic acid and vitamin D receptors. Upon androgen binding to the AR there are two consecutive conformational changes of the receptor [Helsen et al]. From a proteolysis assay it has been found that a fragment of 35 kDa within the ligand binding domain region is initially protected by the ligand. Afterwards, a second conformational change leads to the protection of a smaller fragment of 29 kDa. In vitro assays using the HepG2 cell line showed that flutamide competitively inhibits DHT-mediated transactivation of the AR with a dissociation constant Kb of 1.07 x 10-8M [McIntyre et al]. </p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>It has been proposed that cells with high levels of Wnt activity undergo apoptosis, cells with moderate levels of Wnt activity maintain a proliferative state and cells with low levels of Wnt activity undergo differentiation [Mulholland et al]. The key mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway is the beta-catenin which is present in the membrane maintain cellular adhesion and a cytoplasmic pool which is regulated by an Axin destruction complex  phosphorylating beta-catenin to target it for degradation [Mulholland et al]. Wnt ligand binding to the frizzled receptor inhibits the destruction complex and therefore stabilises the cytoplasmic beta-catenin levels that translocate within the nucleus and associate with Tcf/LEF-1 transcription factors and activate Wnt target genes [Mulholland et al]. A transcription product is Axin2 that forms a secondary beta-catenin destruction complex and creates a negative feed-back for Wnt signalling. Thus, Axin2 can be seen as a biomarker for activation of Wnt signalling [Chen et al].  Treatment with flutamide of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats leads to decreased expression of Axin2 in fibroblasts of the gubernacular core (the gubernaculum is the fetal structure that connects the testis with the scrotum and directs its course in its descent) of male fetuses which were positive for the androgen receptor [Chen et al]. Therefore flutamide treatment represses Wnt signalling [Chen et al].</p>

<p>Flutamide induces feminisation of the external genitalia, nipple retention, alteration of androgen-dependent testicular descent and alteration of the anogenital distance. Flutamide exhibits a potent anti-androgenic activity and induces a dose-dependent decrease in the weight of accessory sex organs at doses of 1 mg/kg and above. Accessory sex organs more sensitive to flutamide at a 20 mg/kg dose are: seminal vesicles, ventral prostate, and Cowper’s glands. Flutamide administered for 15 days reduces accessory sex organs weights but does not affect testes weight. Flutamide increases serum testosterone levels [McIntyre et al (2000), McIntyre et al (2001)].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>The aromatase enzyme is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and therefore is a heme-binding protein. This enzyme is located within the microsomes of oestrogen producing cells, has high substrate specificity and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation.  A complex with a NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase allows the aromatase to catalyse the conversion of C19 androgens to C18 oestrogens. The placenta converts 16-alpha-hydroxy-dehydroepiandrosterone to oestriol, the ovary converts testosterone to oestradiol and the adipose tissue aromatizes androstenedione to oestradiol. Letrozole inhibits peripheral aromatase at doses of 0.5-2.5 mg per day by 98% [Boon et al, Furr].</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Letrozole administered to rats (between 6-16 gestation days) was embryotoxic at doses that were not maternally toxic, showing that the compound could be considered a developmental toxicant [Tiboni et al (2008)]. A significant dose-dependent increase in uterine lethality has been observed in rats exposed to doses lower than or equal to the recommended human therapeutic dose. It has also been found that letrozole increases the frequency of early and late resorptions and at the higher dose increases the ratio of fetal mortality. Letrozole also induced minor structural anomalies of the vertebral bodies [Tiboni et al (2008)]. From these findings it has been suggested that letrozole may not affect organogenesis or that if it does, it induces malformations incompatible with the continuation of the pregnancy [Tiboni et al (2008)]. Oestradiol cyclopentylpropionate (ECP) when administered concomitantly with letrozole gave protection against embryolethality (post-implantation pregnancy loss) at low doses more than at high ones [Tiboni et al (2009)]. Post-implantation pregnancy loss when lower doses of ECP were administered with letrozole was similar to the control group [Tiboni et al (2009)]. Moreover ECP co-administration did not prevent the skeletal anomalies caused by letrozole [Tiboni et al (2009)]. In baboons, letrozole increased significantly the number of pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortion but when it was co-administered with oestradiol the induced increase of miscarriage rate was suppressed [Tiboni et al (2009)]. Letrozole inhibits peripheral aromatase at doses of 0.5-2.5 mg per day by 98% [Tiboni et al (2008)].</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>The induction or augmentation of Wnt signalling by inhibition of HDACs class 1 may be caused by increased expression of Wnt ligands and their receptors, decreased expression of Wnt signalling inhibitors acting at the ligand level, modifications of Wnt ligands and their receptors, and increased cellular secretion of Wnt ligands or increased cell surface presentation of their receptors [Bordonaro et al].</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Wnt binding of Frizzled leads to phosphorylation of Dishevelled, which is a cytoplasmic mediator, and thus to inhibition of the multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, GSK3-beta. This in turn leads to the accumulation of beta catenin [Mulholland et al]. It has been shown in mouse Neuro2A cells that Valproic acid increases the expression of beta-catenin by activation of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway [Phiel et al].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Increased cellular levels and subsequent nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin results in its binding to the amino terminus of the high-mobility group binding protein, T cell factor (Tcf), and promotes its interaction with target DNA sequences (A/TA/TCAAAG), therefore promoting displacement of the Tcf repressors, Groucho and CtBP. This transcription complex activates Wnt target genes [Mulholland et al].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>Exposure of pregnant mice and rats to 75-500 mg/kg of valproic acid (VPA) resulted in increased embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in the corresponding foetuses. The adverse effects included: embryo-lethality and exencephaly (mice only), anterior neural tube defects, somite defects, limb abnormalities, heart malformations  and spina bifida (aperta and occulta) [Binkerd et al, Di Carlo, Ehlers et al (1992a), Ehlers et al (1992b), Narotsky et al, Menegola et al]. Trichostatin A (TSA) also caused similar reproductive defects in a mouse embryo study [Svensson et al]. Carboxylic acids have also been tested in Xenopus [Dawson et al].  Exposure of Xenopus embryos to 5mM VPA after the mid-blastula transition resulted in a significant loss of anterior structures and shortening of the anterior-posterior axis in 88% of the embryos [Dawson et al]. TSA also caused similar effects at 50nM and 100nM in 21% and 77% of the embryos respectively [Phiel et al].</p>

RARs when activated form heterodimers with a RXR which in this case is silent and is not activated by a ligand. RXRs when activated form homodimers. Transcriptional activation of target genes occurs where upon binding to the ligand, a conformational change of the receptors complexed with corepressors leads to release of the corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators. RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to specific DNA elements in regulatory regions of target genes [Bastien and Rochette-Egly].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>In mouse embryonic fibroblasts it has been found that retinoic acid receptors (RARs) bind to 354 loci. RARs bind directly to a DR2 element in the Ctgf promoter and mediate retinoic acid (RA) induction of its expression. RARs also bind to the gene encoding the TGF -beta-3 ligand that is potently activated by RA treatment. RARs also bind genes involved in other pathways of cell cycle regulation and transformation: tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily member 13 (Tnfsf13), cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), metastasis marker nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1), growth factor Fgf18, tyrosine kinase Src, gene encoding Src-related Shc1(A) and cortactin (Cttn) which is a SRC substrate involved in metastasis [Delacroix et al].</p>

<span class="imgEffect_DownstreamEffect" title="Downstream Effect"></span>Repression of the Wnt signalling pathway</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Description</div>
<p>It has been found that in Raldh1 -/-; Raldh3 -/- double mutant mice, loss of retinoic acid signalling leads to up-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in mesenchymal ocular tissues showing that cross-talk between retinoic acid and Wnt signaling is required for eye morphogenesis [Kumar and Duester]. Retinoid signalling potently inhibits the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in colon cancer cells, breast cancer cells and in mesenchymal cell cultures (undifferentiated cells) through physical interactions between beta-catenin and RAR-alpha [Kumar and Duester]. However, retinoid signalling stimulates the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in chondrocyte cultures (differentiated cells) showing that the relationship between these two pathways is differentiation-dependent [Yasuhara et al]. Retinoid signalling represses the Wnt pathway in Xenopus blastula embryos leading to down-regulation of genes important for dorsal development [Li et al]. In this study retinoic acid repression occurs mainly through nuclear beta-catenin and not by interference with its stability.</p>

<p>Fetal malformations observed in Macaca monkeys after administration of 10 mg/kg/day of retinoic acid (RA, all trans configuration) between gestational days 24-35 were the following: hypoplasia of the facial cranium with misconfigured bones, hypertelorism and cleft palate, exophthalmos, and defects of the external ear [Biesalski]. Exencephaly, anophthalmia or maxillomandibular ankylosis observed in rodents after a single dose [Lohnes et al, Elmazar et al]  have not been observed in primates because these types of malformations require a repeated dose in order to manifest [Biesalski]. 13-cis RA is 4-8 times less teratogenic than all trans RA in comparison for the incidence of cleft palate and extremities malformation [Biesalski]. The dose of 13-cis RA that leads to cleft palate seems to be species-dependent: 150 mg/kg/day in rats and 10 mg/kg/day in rabbits [Biesalski]. Retinoic acid malformations that have been observed in humans are: microtia or anotia, faulty development of the facial cranial bones, cardiac defects, thymic hypoplasia and aplasia and malformation of the central nervous system [Biesalski].</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">How this Key Event works</div>
<p>Site of action: The molecular site of action is the ligand binding domain of the AR. The cellular site of action for the molecular initiating event is undefined.Responses at the macromolecular level: Binding of a ligand, including xenobiotics that act as AR agonists, to the cytosolic AR mediates a conformational shift that facilitates dissociation from accompanying heat shock proteins and dimerization with another AR (Prescott and Coetzee 2006; Claessens et al. 2008; Centenera et al. 2008). Homodimerization unveils a nuclear localization sequence, allowing the AR-ligand complex to translocate to the nucleus and bind to androgen-response elements (AREs) (Claessens et al. 2008; Cutress et al. 2008). This elicits recruitment of additional transcription factors and transcriptional activation of androgen-responsive genes (Heemers and Tindall 2007).</p>
</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Measurment/detection</div>
<p>Provide a summary of the available measurment and detection methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">How it is Measured or Detected</div>
<p>Methods that have been previously reviewed and approved by a recognized authority should be included in the Overview section above. All other methods, including those well established in the published literature, should be described here. Consider the following criteria when describing each method: 1. Is the assay fit for purpose? 2. Is the assay directly or indirectly (i.e. a surrogate) related to a key event relevant to the final adverse effect in question? 3. Is the assay repeatable? 4. Is the assay reproducible?
Measurement/detection: Binding to the androgen receptor can be directly measured in cell free systems based on displacement of a radio-labeled standard (generally testosterone or DHT) in a competitive binding assay (e.g., (Olsson et al. 2005; Sperry and Thomas 1999; Wilson et al. 2007; Tilley et al. 1989; Kim et al. 2010). However, cell based transcriptional activation assays are typically required to differentiate agonists from antagonists, in vitro. A number of reporter gene assays have been developed and used to screen chemicals for AR agonist and/or antagonist activity (e.g., (Wilson et al. 2002; van der Burg et al. 2010; Mak et al. 1999; Araki et al. 2005). Expression of androgen responsive proteins like spiggin in primary cell cultures has also been used to detect AR agonist activity (Jolly et al. 2006).
In fish, phenotypic masculinization of females has frequently been used as an indirect measurement of in vivo androgen receptor agonism. For example, development of nuptial tubercles, a dorsal fatpad, and a characteristic banding pattern has been observed in female fathead minnows exposed to androgen agonists (Ankley et al. 2003; Jensen et al. 2006; Ankley et al. 2010; LaLone et al. 2013). Likewise, anal fin elongation in female western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) has similarly been viewed as evidence of AR activation (Raut et al. 2011; Sone et al. 2005).</p>
</div>
<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Evidence Supporting Taxonomic Applicability</div>
<p>Taxonomic applicability: Androgen receptor orthologs are primarily limited to vertebrates (Baker 1997; Thornton 2001; Eick and Thornton 2011; Markov and Laudet 2011). Therefore, this MIE would generally be viewed as relevant to vertebrates, but not necessarily invertebrates.</p>

<p>Characterization of chemical properties: Androgen receptor binding chemicals can be grouped into two broad structural domains, steroidal and non-steroidal (Yin et al. 2003). Steroidal androgens consist primarily of testosterone and its derivatives (Yin et al. 2003). Many of the non-steroidal AR binding chemicals studied are derivatives of well known non-steroidal AR antagonists like bicalutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and nilutamide (Yin et al. 2003). Nonetheless, a number of QSARs and SARs that consider AR binding of both these pharmaceutical agents as well as environmental chemicals have been developed (Waller et al. 1996; Serafimova et al. 2002; Todorov et al. 2011; Hong et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004). However, it has been shown that very minor structural differences can dramatically impact function as either an agonist or antagonist (Yin et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004; Norris et al. 2009), making it difficult at present to predict agonist versus antagonist activity based on chemical structure alone.</p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">How this Key Event works</div>
<p>Testosterone is synthesized in ovarian theca cells through a series of enzyme catalyzed reactions that convert cholesterol to androgens (see KEGG reference pathway 00140 for details; www.genome.jp/kegg; (Payne and Hales 2004; Magoffin 2005; Young and McNeilly 2010). Binding of luteinizing hormone to luteinizing hormone receptors located on the surface of theca cell membranes leads to increased expression of steriodogenic cytochrome P450s, steroidogeneic acute regulatory protein, and consequent increases in androgen production (Payne and Hales 2004; Miller 1988; Miller and Strauss 1999).</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">How it is Measured or Detected</div>
<p>Steroid production by isolated primary theca cells can be measured using radioimmunoassay or enzyme immunoassay approaches (e.g., (Benninghoff and Thomas 2006; Campbell et al. 1998). However, the isolation and culture methods are not trivial. Similarly, development of immortalized theca cell lines has proven challenging (Havelock et al. 2004). Consequently, this key event is perhaps best evaluated by examining T production by intact ovarian tissue explants either exposed to chemicals in vitro (e.g., (Villeneuve et al. 2007; McMaster ME 1995) or in vivo (i.e., via ex vivo steroidogenesis assay; e.g., (Ankley et al. 2007)). Reductions in T production by ovarian tissue explants can indicate either direct inhibition of steriodogenic enzymes involved in T synthesis, or indirect impacts due to feedback along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (in cases where chemical exposures occur in vivo). However, because T synthesis in the theca cells is closely linked to estradiol (E2) synthesis by granulosa cells, reductions in T production by intact ovary tissue can also be due to increased aromatase activity and the resulting increased rate of converting T to E2.</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Abstract</div>
<p>It is well documented and accepted that learning and memory processes rely on physiological functioning of the glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDAR). Both animal and human studies investigating NMDA itself, experiments with NMDAR antagonists and mutant mice lacking NMDAR subunits strongly support this statement (Rezvani, 2006). Activation of NMDARs results in long-term potentiation (LTP), which is related to increased synaptic strength, plasticity and memory formation in the hippocampus (Johnston et al., 2009). LTP induced by activation of NMDA receptors has been found to be elevated in the developing rodent brain compared to the mature brain, partially due to 'developmental switch' of the NMDAR 2A and 2B subunits (Johnston et al., 2009). Activation of the NMDAR also enhances brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, which promotes neuronal survival, differentiation and synaptogenesis (Tyler et al., 2002; Johnston et al., 2009). Consequently, the blockage of NMDAR by chemical substances during synaptogenesis disrupts neuronal network formation resulting in the impairment of learning and memory processes (Toscano and Guilarte, 2005). This AOP is relevant to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT). The molecular initiating event (MIE) is described as the chronic binding of antagonist to NMDAR in neurons during synaptogenesis (development) in hippocampus (one of the critical brain structures for learning and memory formation). One of the chemicals that blocks NMDAR after chronic exposure is lead (Pb2+), a well-known developmental neurotoxicant.</p>

<h3>NMDARs, Binding of antagonist</h3>
</a>
<p><html>The MIE is defined and described above as the binding of antagonist to NMDA receptor in neurons during development in hippocampus and cortex (the critical brain structures for learning and memory formation). Activation of NMDA receptors results in long-term potentiation (LTP), which is related to increased synaptic strength and memory formation in the hippocampus (Johnston et al., 2009). LTP induced by activation of NMDA receptors has been found to be elevated in the developing rodent brain compared to the mature brain, partially due to "developmental switch" of the NMDAR 2A and 2B subunits (Johnston et al., 2009).<br><br><b>Essentiality of MIE (binding of antagonist to NMDAR in neurons during synaptogenesis in hippocampus and cortex) for AO (Impairment of learning and memory) is STRONG:</b> It is well documented that learning and memory processes rely on physiological functioning of NMDA receptors. The essentiality of the MIE has been demonstrated in both animal and human studies investigating NMDA itself, NMDA receptors antagonists and mutant mice lacking NMDA receptor subunits (reviewed in Haberny et al., 2002; Rezvani, 2006 and Granger et al., 2011). NMDA systemically administered in rats, has been shown to potentiate cognitive functions (Rezvani, 2006). There are various studies dealing with specific NMDA receptor subunit gene knock-out leading to a variety of phenotypes. Depending on the endogenous levels of NMDAR subunits, the pattern of their expression and their importance in developmental processes, the loss of a subunit may lead from early embryonic lethality, to mild neurobehavioral impairment up to neuronal disorders that manifest learning and memory deficits (reviewed in Rezvani, 2006 and Granger et al., 2011). Mutant mice lacking NR1 gene have shown perinatal lethality, whereas transgenic mice lacking NR1 subunit in the CA1 region of the hippocampus show both defective LTP and severe deficits in both spatial and nonspatial learning (Shimizu et al., 2000; Tsien et al., 1996). A similar impairment of LTP, long-term depression (LTD), and spatial memory has been seen with CA1-specific NR2B deletion (Brigman et al. 2010). However, LTP has been normal in postnatal forebrain knock-out of NR2A in mice, even though spatial memory has been impaired, probably because of the severe reduction observed in overall excitatory transmission (Shimshek et al., 2006), while the inactivation of the same gene has led to reduced hippocampal LTP and spatial learning (Sakimura et al., 1995). Furthermore, a NR2B transgenic (Tg) line of mice has been developed, in which the NMDA-receptor function has been increased, showing both larger LTP in the hippocampus and superior learning and memory (Tang et al., 1999). Finally, depletion of both NR2A and NR2B in single neurons has shown alteration in synaptic development (Gray et al., 2011). Interestingly, during development, especially during postnatal days (PND) 7-14 in rodents, the central nervous system (CNS) exhibits increased susceptibility to toxic insults that affect NMDA receptors (Haberny et al., 2002). This increased susceptibility has been suggested to be related to the elevated expression of specific NMDA receptor subunits (Miyamoto et al., 2001). Because of the critical role of the NMDA receptor system in brain development, the exposure to antagonists of NMDA receptors can have long-lasting and severe effects (Behar et al., 1999). NMDA-receptor antagonists such as MK-801, ketamine, phencyclidine (PCP) and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5 or APV) have been extensively used to study the role of NMDA in learning and memory in developing organisms. Both acute and subchronic administration of NMDA-receptor antagonists in several laboratory animals has been shown to impair performance on tasks that seem to depend upon hippocampal functions (reviewed in Rezvani, 2006; Haberny et al., 2002). The developmental neurotoxicity of several agents, including methylmercury, lead, and ethanol is also thought to result from interaction of these substances with the NMDA receptor system (Guilarte, 1997; Guilarte and McGlothan, 1998; Ikonomidou et al., 2000; Kumari and Ticku, 1998; Miyamoto et al., 2001).<br><br><b>Essentiality of MIE (binding of antagonist to NMDAR in neurons during synaptogenesis in hippocampus and cortex for KE (aberrant dendritic morphology) is MODERATE:</b> The cortex-restricted knockout of NR1 causes refinement in dendritic arborisation in cortex and loss of patterning (Iwasato et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2005). Similar alteration in dendritic arbor has also been identified after depletion of both NR2A and NR2B subunits in isolated neurons (Espinosa et al., 2009). Blockade of NMDA receptor with APV has shown decrease of dendritic growth rate in some in vivo experimental approaches (Rajan et al., 1999; Rajan and Cline, 1998). However, other studies have reported increase in dendritic spine number and dendritic branching after chronic APV-treatment both in vivo and in vitro (Rocha and Sur, 1995; McAllister et al., 1996). This discrepancy is possibly attributed to the different developmental expression of NMDA receptor subunits that triggers distinct intracellular signaling pathways linking NMDAR function to different morphological findings.<br><br><b>Essentiality of MIE (binding of antagonist to NMDAR in neurons during synaptogenesis in hippocampus and cortex) for KE (cell death) is STRONG:</b> The essential role of NMDA receptors in survival during early cortical development has been pointed out both in in vitro (Hwang et al., 1999; Yoon et al., 2003) and in vivo rodent studies (Ikonomidou et al., 1999). NMDA receptor deficient mice have revealed the importance of this receptor for neuronal survival during development as an approximately 2-fold increase in developmental cell death has been observed in these transgenic mice, which was caspase-3 and Bax dependent (Adams et al., 2004; Rivero Vaccari et al., 2006).<br><br><b>Essentiality of MIE for KE (decreased neuronal network function) is STRONG:</b> The NMDA receptor is associated with circuit formation and function at the developmental stage of an organism as a number of antagonists of this receptor importantly disrupt the neuronal circut (Simon et al., 1992). Hence, the nature of evidence for the essentiality of the MIE is High (Strong).</html></p>

<h3>NMDARs, Inhibition</h3>
</a>
<p><html><b>Essentiality of KE (Inhibition of NMDA receptors) for AO (Impairment of learning and memory))</b> is <b>STRONG:</b> The noncompetitive antagonist MK-801 has been shown to induce dose-dependent impairment of learning and memory (Wong et al., 1986) and data on rodent models has been recently reviewed in van der Staay et al. 2011. Learning impairments induced by NMDA receptor blockade using MK-801 have also been reported in nonhuman primates (Ogura and Aigner, 1993). Moreover there are human studies demonstrating that NMDA-receptor inhibition impairs learning and memory processes (reviewed in Rezvani, 2006).</html</p>

<p><html><b>Essentiality of KE (Decreased Calcium influx) for AO (Impairment of learning and memory)</b> is <b>STRONG:</b> In the nervous system, many intracellular responses to modified Ca2+ levels are mediated by calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein kinases (CaMKs), a family of protein kinases that are initially modulated by binding of Ca2+ to CaM and subsequently by protein phosphorylation (Wayman et al., 2008). Multifunctional CaMKs, such as CaMKII and members of CaMK cascade (CaMKK, CaMKI and CaMKIV) are highly abundant in CNS and regulate different protein substrates (Soderling, 1999). Mice with a mutation in the alpha- CaMKII that is abundantly found in the hippocampus have shown spatial learning impairments, whereas some types of non-spatial learning peocesses have not been affected (Silva et al., 1992).</p>

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Quantitative Considerations</div>
<p><i>Provide an overall discussion of the quantitative information available for this AOP. Support calls for the individual relationships can be included in the Key Event Relationship table above.</i><br><br>

A quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model has been developed based on various molecular parameters that have been calculated for a series of competitive NMDA antagonists with known activity values and these parameters have been applied to make a regression analysis which provides a model that relates the computationally calculated parameters to experimentally determined activity values (Korkut and Varnali, 2003).<br><br>

Recently, a QSAR model for non- competitive antagonists of NMDA receptor based on a series of 48 substituted MK-801 derivatives has been established (Chtitaa et al., 2015). In this paper, a quantitative model has been proposed and there has also been an attempt to interpret the activity of the compounds relying on the multivariate statistical analyses. By this approach, they have been able to predict the inhibitory activity of a set of new designed compounds (Chtitaa et al., 2015).<br><br>

2D- and 3D-QSAR models have also been developed to establish the structural requirements for pyrazine and related derivatives for being NR2B selective NMDA receptor antagonists (Zambre et al., 2015).

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Applicability of the AOP</div>
<p><b>• Life Stage Applicability: </b>

Life Stage Applicability: This AOP is applicable only for specific period of brain development that is the time of synaptogenesis. This vulnerable period of synaptogenesis appears to happen in different developmental stages across species. For example, in rodents primarily synaptogenesis occurs during the first two weeks after birth. For rhesus monkeys, this period ranges from approximately 115-day gestation up to PND 60. In humans, it starts from the third trimester of pregnancy and continues 2-3 years following birth (Bai et al., 2013). Furthermore, synaptogenesis does not happen in a uniform way in all brain regions and there are important differences between the times of appearance of the main two types of synapses (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). For example, in rat hippocampus excitatory synapses are well established or fully mature within the two first postnatal weeks, whereas inhibitory synapses cannot be found prior to PND 18, after which it increases steadily to reach adult levels at PND 28. In addition, in rat neostriatal neurons the excitatory responses to both cortical and thalamic stimuli can be observed by PND 6, but the long-lasting hyperpolarization and late depolarization is never seen before PND 12.<br><br>

<b>• Taxonomic Applicability: </b>The data used to support the KERs in this AOP derives from experimental studies conducted in rats and mice or cell cultures of similar origin as well as from human epidemiological studies. The majority of the KEs in this AOP seem to be highly conserved across species. It remains to be proved if these KERs of the present AOP are also applicable for other species rather than human, primates, rats and mice.<br><br>

<b>• Sex Applicability:</b>The majority of the studies addressing the KEs and KERs of this AOP were carried out mainly in male laboratory animals. Few studies are available in females and some of them compare the effects between females and males. It appears that this AOP is applicable for both females and males.<br><br>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Considerations for Potential Applications of the AOP (optional)</div>
<p>Exposure to xenobiotics can potentially affect the nervous system resulting in neurobehavioral alterations and/or neurological clinical symptoms. To assess the neurotoxic properties of compounds, current testing largely relies on neurobehavioural tests in laboratory animals, histopathological analysis, neurochemical and occasionally electrophysiological observations. Throughout the years, a significant number of methods have been developed to assess neurobehaviour in laboratory animals and a comprehensive summary of them can be found in OECD Series on testing and assessment, number 20, Guidance Document for Neurotoxicity Testing (2004). Learning and memory is an important endpoint and a wide variety of tests to assess chemical effects on cognitive functions is available and used for the study of neurotoxicity in adult and young laboratory animals. Some of these tests that allow the appreciation of cognitive function in laboratory animals are: habituation, ethologically based anxiety tests (elevated plus maze test, black and white box test, social interaction test), conditioned taste aversion (CTA), active avoidance, passive avoidance, spatial mazes (Morris water maze, Biel water maze, T-maze), conditional discrimination (simple discrimination, matching to sample), delayed discrimination (delayed matching-to-sample, delayed alternation) and eye-blink conditioning.

The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 and OECD 426, respectively) require testing of learning and memory. These DNT Guidelines have been used to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009). Also in the scope of the OECD Test Guideline for Combined Repeated Dose Toxicity Study with Reproduction/Developmental Toxicity Screening Test (422) and OECD Test Guideline for Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (443), learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of DNT studies. These DNT guidelines are based entirely on in vivo experiments, which are costly, time consuming, and unsuitable for testing a larger number of chemicals. For these reasons, there is currently no regulatory request for DNT studies prior to registration of new chemicals and recommendations for DNT testing are only based on certain triggers such as structural similarity with known reproductive toxicants, concerns for endocrine disruption, results from other toxicity studies, and the anticipated use and human exposure patterns. At the same time the published data strongly suggest that environmental chemicals contribute to the observed increase in children neurodevelopmental disorders such as lowered IQ, learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, in particular, autism. This highlights the pressing need for standardised alternative methodologies that can more rapidly and cost-effectively screen large numbers of chemicals for their potential to cause cognitive deficit in children.

The present AOP can encourage the development of new in vitro assays test battery and the use of these alternatives to assess NMDAR inhibitors as chemicals with potential to induce impairment of children cognitive function and at the same time reduce the use of in vivo studies. Some of the KEs presented in this AOP have already been identified as endpoints to be measured during the mapping of available in vitro and alternative DNT testing methods by EFSA (Fritsche et al., 2015). In addition, the majority of KEs in this AOP has strong essentiality to induce the AO (impairment of learning and memory) and established indirect relationship with the AO that would allow not only the development of testing methods that address these specific KEs but also the understanding of the relationship between the measured KEs and the AO. The present AOP can potentially provide the basis for development of a mechanistically informed IATA for DNT. The construction of IATA for predicting DNT effects is expected to make use of more than one AOP within an interconnected network in order to take into consideration all possible biological processes that may contribute to impairment of learning and memory in developing organisms. Through this network, common KEs can emerge that should be considered during IATA construction and that may inform also assay development.

Results derived from assays based on the KEs of this AOP can serve to interpret and accept results that derive from non-standard test methods. Omics data from toxicogenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies can be interpreted in a structured way following this AOP as a guide. Finally, this AOP could provide the opportunity to group chemicals using not only chemical properties but also mechanistic information that can later inform data gap filling by read-across.

<p><html><b>Biological state:</b> L-glutamate (Glu) is a neurotransmitter with important role in the regulation of brain development and maturation processes. Two major classes of Glu receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic, have been identified. Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are integral membrane proteins formed by four large subunits that compose a central ion channel pore. In case of NMDA receptors, two NR1 subunits are combined with either two NR2 (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) subunits and less commonly are assembled together with a combination of NR2 and NR3 (A, B) subunits (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). To be activated NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of both glutamate to NR2 subunits and of glycine to either NR1 or NR3 subunits that provide the specific binding sites named extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Apart from LBDs, NMDA receptor subunits contain three more domains that are considered semiautonomous: 1) the extracellular amino-terminal domain that plays important role in assembly and trafficking of these receptors; 2) the transmembrane domain that is linked with LBD and contributes to the formation of the core of the ion channel and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain that influences membrane targeting, stabilization, degradation and post-translation modifications.<br><br><b>Biological compartments:</b> The genes of the NMDAR subunits are expressed in various tissues and are not only restricted to the nervous system. The level of expression of these receptors in neuronal and non-neuronal cells depends on: transcription, chromatin remodelling, mRNA levels, translation, stabilization of the protein, receptor assembly and trafficking, energy metabolism and numerous environmental stimuli (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010).<br><br>In hippocampus region of the brain, NR2A and NR2B are the most abundant NR2 family subunits. NR2A-containing NMDARs are mostly expressed synaptically, while NR2B-containing NMDARs are found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999).<br><br><b>General role in biology:</b> NMDA receptors, when compared to the other Glu receptors, are characterized by higher affinity for Glu, slower activation and desensitisation kinetics, higher permeability for calcium (Ca2+) and susceptibility to potential-dependent blockage by magnesium ions (Mg2+). NMDA receptors are involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Functions of NMDA receptors:<br><br> 1. They are involved in cell signalling events converting environmental stimuli to genetic changes by regulating gene transcription and epigenetic modifications in neuronal cells (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008).<br><br>	2. In NMDA receptors, the ion channel is blocked by extracellular Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, allowing the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell which is voltage-dependent. Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptor is considered to play a critical role in pre- and post-synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism important for learning and memory (Barria and Malinow, 2002).<br><br>	3. The NMDA receptors have been shown to play an essential role in the strengthening of synapses and neuronal differentiation, through long-term potentiation (LTP), and the weakening of synapses, through long-term depression (LTD). All these processes are implicated in the memory and learning function (Barria and Malinow, 2002).<br><br><html></p>

However, there are methods described in the scientific literature that allow measuring:<br><br><b>1. Ex vivo: </b>The most common assay used is the NMDA receptor (MK801 site) radioligand competition binding assays (Reynolds, 2001; Gao et al., 2013; http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/UNC-CH%20Protocol%20Book.pdf; http://www.currentprotocols.com/WileyCDA/CPUnit/refId-ph0120.html).

Due to its physiological and pharmacological properties, Glu activates three classes of ionotropic receptors named: Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA receptors), 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-4-isopropenylpyrrolidine (kainate receptors) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors, NMDARs), which transduce the postsynaptic signal. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are integral membrane proteins formed by four large subunits that compose a central ion channel pore. In case of NMDA receptors, two NR1 subunits are combined with either two NR2 (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) subunits and less commonly are assembled together with a combination of NR2 and NR3 (A, B) subunits (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). To be activated NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of both glutamate to NR2 subunits and of glycine to either NR1 or NR3 subunits that provide the specific binding sites named extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Apart from LBDs, NMDA receptor subunits contain three more domains that are considered semiautonomous: 1) the extracellular amino-terminal domain that plays important role in assembly and trafficking of these receptors; 2) the transmembrane domain that is linked with LBD and contributes to the formation of the core of the ion channel and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain that influences membrane targeting, stabilization, degradation and post-translation modifications.<br><br><b>Biological compartments:</b> The genes of the NMDAR subunits are expressed in various tissues and are not only restricted to the nervous system. The level of expression of these receptors in neuronal and non-neuronal cells depends on: transcription, chromatin remodelling, mRNA levels, translation, stabilization of the protein, receptor assembly and trafficking, energy metabolism and numerous environmental stimuli (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010).<br><br>In hippocampus region of the brain, NR2A and NR2B are the most abundant NR2 family subunits. NR2A-containing NMDARs are mostly expressed synaptically, while NR2B-containing NMDARs are found both synaptically and extrasynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999).<br><br><b>General role in biology:</b> NMDA receptors, when compared to the other Glu receptors, are characterized by higher affinity for Glu, slower activation and desensitisation kinetics, higher permeability for calcium (Ca2+) and susceptibility to potential-dependent blockage by magnesium ions (Mg2+). NMDA receptors are involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Functions of NMDA receptors:<br><br>1. They are involved in cell signalling events converting environmental stimuli to genetic changes by regulating gene transcription and epigenetic modifications in neuronal cells (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008).<br><br>2. In NMDA receptors, the ion channel is blocked by extracellular Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, allowing the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the cell and K+ out of the cell which is voltage-dependent. Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptor is considered to play a critical role in pre- and post-synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism important for learning and memory (Barria and Malinow, 2002).<br><br>3. The NMDA receptors have been shown to play an essential role in the strengthening of synapses and neuronal differentiation, through long-term potentiation (LTP), and the weakening of synapses, through long-term depression (LTD). All these processes are implicated in the memory and learning function (Barria and Malinow, 2002).<br><br><html></p>

MEAs can also be applied in higher throughput platforms to facilitate screening of numerous chemical compounds based on electrical activity measurements (McConnell et al., 2012).</html></p>

<p><html><b>Biological state:</b> Under physiological resting conditions of the cell, the free intracellular Ca2+ reaches around 100 nM, whereas the extracellular Ca2+ can be found at higher concentrations of 1.2 mM that under certain stimulus may invade the cell (Berridge et al, 2000). Six to seven oxygen atoms surround Ca2+, whereas the protein chelator of Ca2+ is the EF motif that is present in many proteins such as calmodulin (Clapham, 2007). The EF-hand is a helix-loop-helix calcium-binding motif in which two helices pack together at an angle of approximately 90 degrees (Lewit-Bentley and RÃ©ty, 2000). The two helices are separated by a loop region where calcium actually binds. The EF notation for the motif is derived from the notation applied to the structure of parvalbumin, in which the E and F helices were originally identified as forming this calcium-binding motif.<br><br><b>Biological compartments:</b> Ca2+ ions accumulate in the cytoplasm, cellular organelles (e.g. mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) and nucleus in response to diverse classes of stimuli.<br><br><b>General role in biology:</b> In order to adapt to altered stimulus from exposure to different environmental factors, cells require signal transmission. However, signalling needs messengers whose concentration is modified upon stimulus (Clapham, 2007). Ca2+ ions act as an important intracellular messenger playing the role of ubiquitous signalling molecules and consequently regulate many different cellular functions (Berridge, 2012; Hagenston and Bading, 2011). Given its important role in processes that are fundamental to all cell types, Ca2+ homeostasis is tightly regulated by intracellular and extracellular mechanisms (Barhoumi et al., 2010). Intracellular Ca2+ concentration is regulated by opening or closing channels in the plasma membrane. Additionally, the Ca2+ ions can be released from intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through ryanodine receptors (RYRs) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Ca2+ homeostasis is also regulated by the mechanisms that remove Ca2+ from the cytosol, for example pumps in both cell membrane and ER membrane. In addition, cytosolic Ca2+ regulation involves accumulation of Ca2+ in mitochondria that have the capacity to buffer the excess of cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions. In neurons, Ca2+ ions regulate many critical functions. Firstly, they contribute to dendritic electrical signalling, producing postsynaptic depolarization by the current carried by Ca2+ ions. Secondly, Ca2+ activates Ca2+-sensitive proteins such as different kinases, calcineurin and calpain, triggering signalling pathways critical for cell physiology. Modification of the gene transcription is the final outcome of the Ca2+ ions impact on long-term modifications affecting neurotransmitters release (reviewed in Neher and Sakaba, 2008), neuronal differentiation, synapse function and cell viability (Clapham, 2007; Higley and Sabatini, 2012). Thus, the Ca2+ that enters and accumulates in cytoplasm and nucleus is a central signalling molecule that regulates synapse and neuronal cell function, including learning and memory processes (Berridge, 2012; Hagenston and Bading, 2011).<html></p>

By applying simple Ca2+ indicators such as dextran or acetoxymethyl esters to more powerful genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators, zebrafish provides a transparent model where live Ca2+ imaging can be successfully achieved (Kettunen, 2012).</html></p>

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Definition</div>
<p>Provide brief description of the (key) event

Biological state: BDNF belongs to a family of closely related neurotrophic factors named neurotrophins and is widely expressed in the developing and mature CNS. In the rodent cortex, postnatal BDNF expression is initially low but slowly increases to reach high levels around weaning. Therefore, BDNF expression peaks at a time when both structural and functional maturation of cortical circuitry occurs. During postnatal development, BDNF levels are dynamically regulated, in part by neuronal activity dependent mechanisms (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). Glutamate has been shown to increase the transcription and release of BDNF. Indeed, BDNF is synthesized, stored and released from glutamatergic neurons (Lessmann et al., 2003). 

Biological compartments: BDNF initially is synthesized as precursor proteins (proBDNF), which is processed intracellularly to be transformed in its mature form (mBDNF) after proteolytically cleaved in the synaptic cleft by plasmin which is a protease activated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Cohen-Cory et al., 2010). proBDNF is constantly secreted while tPA release and mBDNF production depends on neuronal excitation (Head et al., 2009). Storage and activity-dependent release of BDNF has been demonstrated in both dendrites and axon terminals (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). More specifically, in hippocampus, BDNF appears to be stored in dendritic processes of neurons (Balkowiec and Katz, 2002). BDNF is abundant in cerebellum and cortex and has also been measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Zhang et al., 2008), whole blood, plasma, serum (plasma without clotting factors) and platelets (Trajkovska et al., 2007). BDNF has been found to be produced by astrocytes under both physiological and pathological conditions (Endo, 2005; Coco et al., 2013; Nelson and Alkon, 2014). 

In humans, mBDNF is sequestered in platelets, consequently BDNF can reach all tissues and organs. Lymphocytic cells have been shown to express BDNF in vitro similarly to eosinophils, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. The visceral and airway epithelium are also significant sources of BDNF. Female reproductive system including ovaries, placenta and uterus also express BDNF (Wessels et al., 2014). 

General role in biology: The biological functions of mBDNF are mediated by binding to tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor that leads to the activation of three major intracellular signalling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K and PLCÎ³1 (SoulÃ© et al., 2006). TrkB-mediated signaling regulates gene transcription in the nucleus through the activation of several transcription factors. These genes are involved in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, synapse maturation and stabilization (Pang et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2005; Nelson and Alkon, 2014). 

On the other hand, proBDNF binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and activates RhoA, a small GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeleton polymerization leading to inhibition of axonal elongation, growth cone collapse, and apoptosis (Dubreuil et al., 2003; Yamauchi et al., 2004; Head et al., 2009).

No OECD methods are available to measure BDNF protein and mRNA levels. Depending on the tissue or fluid measurements distinct methods are used. 

Brain tissue: BDNF protein levels can be measured by commercial available antibody sandwich ELISA kits, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. BDNF primers for different exons are available to determine mRNA levels by RT-PCR. The Bdnf gene consists of multiple alternative exons (ten in human, eight in rodents and six in lower vertebrates), and a single exon coding for the entire pro-BDNF protein (Cohen-Cory et al., 2010). 

Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF): There are available commercial antibody sandwich ELISA kits (Trajkovska et al., 2007) and immunobead-based multiplex assays for high throughput screening (Zhang et al., 2008). 

Whole blood, serum, plasma and platelets: There are several commercial double antibody sandwich ELISA kits that can be used for identification of BDNF levels in biological fluids (Trajkovska et al., 2007). 

Methodological considerations that have to be taken into account during sample preparation and measurement of BDNF by ELISA have been recently reviewed in Elfving et al. 2010. A study measuring BDNF by a commercially available ELISA kit in various tissues and biological liquids derived from distinct species revealed that BDNF is undetectable in mouse blood and pig plasma (Klein et al., 2011). This study also showed that in most cases BDNF levels are comparable to levels reported in humans and that there is positive correlation between blood BDNF levels and hippocampal BDNF levels in rats and pigs (Klein et al., 2011).

<div class="descriptionContent">
<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Definition</div>
<p>Provide brief description of the (key) event

Biological state: Glutamate is an amino acid with neurotransmitter function that is stored in presynaptic vesicles by the action of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and under physiological conditions is found at a concentration of 100 mmol/L per vesicle. Different mechanisms are involved in the release of glutamate (reviewed in Meldrum, 2000). Glutamate is mainly released from the vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent mechanism that involves N- and P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, closely linked to vesicle docking sites. However, glutamate can also be released by reverse operation during reduction of Na+ and K+ gradient across the membrane like for example during cerebral ischemia. Interestingly, the synaptic release of glutamate is controlled by a wide range of presynaptic receptors that are not only glutamatergic like Group II and Group III of glutamate metabotropic receptors but also cholinergic such as nicotinic and muscarinic, adenosine (A1), kappa opioid, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B, cholecystokinin and neuropeptide Y (Y2) receptors. 

The synaptic effects of glutamate are rapidly terminated by action of glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters [EAATs]) located on the plasma membrane of astrocytes and neurons. Therefore, pre-synaptically released glutamate is mostly transported via EAATs to astrocytes and only a small portion is re-uptaken from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic terminals(Rundfeldt et al., 1994; Blanke and VanDongen, 2009). 

Following its release, glutamate exerts its effects via ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Although glutamate is available for binding to receptors for a short time, NMDA receptors show high affinity for this specific neurotransmitter that causes their activation compared to other receptors. 

Biological compartments: Glutamate is the most abundant amino acid in the diet, consequently is found at higher levels in plasma compared to cerebrospinal fluid. The blood brain barrier prevents the entry of glutamate, meaning that the glutamate present in CNS is derived from de novo synthesis of this neurotransmitter relying on the recycling of the main resources. Glutamine and Î±-ketoglutarate are the major precursors of glutamate. Glutamine is converted via phosphate-activated glutaminase to glutamate and ammonia, whereas Î±-ketoglutarate is transaminated into glutamate (Platt, 2007). In glial cells, the glutamate is metabolised via glutamine synthase into glutamine or metabolised into Î±-ketoglutarate. These products are actively transported out of the glial cells and back into the pre-synaptic terminals for subsequent re-synthesis and storage of glutamate. 

Five transporters of glutamate have been identified in the CNS. Two are expressed predominantly in glia and three in neurons (reviewed in Meldrum, 2000). The presence of glutamate has also been demonstrated in other tissues and organs as glutamate receptors have been found to be expressed in pancreatic Î²-cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts of bones (Nedergaard et al., 2002). 

General role in biology: In mature nervous system, glutamate is known to play important role in synaptic plasticity. Similarly important is this neurotransmitter during development where it regulates neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and apoptosis (reviewed in Mattson, 1996; Meldrum, 2000; Mattson, 2008). 

The proper functioning of the central nervous system relays on the physiological homeostasis between glutamate and GABA, creating the opposite excitatory/inhibitory forces in the brain. Together, these two neurotransmitters constitute more than 90% of all neurotransmission. If this homeostasis is disturbed it could lead to anxiety disorders (Wieronska et al., 2015).

<div class="descriptionSectionTitle">Definition</div>
<p>Provide brief description of the (key) event

Two types of cell death can be distinguished by morphological features, although it is likely that these are two ends of a spectrum with possible intermediate forms. Apoptosis involves shrinkage, nuclear disassembly, and fragmentation of the cell into discrete bodies with intact plasma membranes. These are rapidly phagocytosed by neighbouring cells. An important feature of apoptosis is the requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to initiate the execution phase. In contrast, necrotic cell death is characterised by cell swelling and lysis. This is usually a consequence of profound loss of mitochondrial function and resultant ATP depletion, leading to loss of ion homeostasis, including volume regulation, and increased Ca2+. The latter activates a number of nonspecific hydrolases (i.e. proteases, nucleases, and phospholipases) as well as calcium dependent kinases. Activation of calpain I, the Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease cleaves the death-promoting Bcl-2 family members Bid and Bax which translocate to mitochondrial membranes, resulting in release of truncated apoptosis-inducing factor (tAIF), cytochrome c and endonuclease in the case of Bid and cytochrome c in the case of Bax. tAIF translocates to cell nuclei, and together with cyclophilin A and phosphorylated histone H2AX (Î³H2AX) is responsible for DNA cleavage, a feature of programmed necrosis. Activated calpain I has also been shown to cleave the plasma membrane Na+â€“Ca2+ exchanger, which leads to build-up of intracellular Ca2+, which is the source of additional increased intracellular Ca2+. Cytochrome c in cellular apoptosis is a component of the apoptosome. 

DNA damage activates nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP-1), a DNA repair enzyme. PARP-1 forms poly(ADP-ribose) polymers, to repair DNA, but when DNA damage is extensive, PAR accumulates, exits cell nuclei and travels to mitochondrial membranes, where it, like calpain I, is involved in AIF release from mitochondria. A fundamental distinction between necrosis and apoptosis is the loss of plasma membrane integrity; this is integral to the former but not the latter. As a consequence, lytic release of cellular constituents promotes a local inflammatory reaction, whereas the rapid removal of apoptotic bodies minimises such a reaction. The distinction between the two modes of death is easily accomplished in vitro but not in vivo. Thus, although claims that certain drugs induce apoptosis have been made, these are relatively unconvincing. DNA fragmentation can occur in necrosis, leading to positive TUNEL staining. Conversely, when apoptosis is massive, it can exceed the capacity for rapid phagocytosis, resulting in the eventual appearance of secondary necrosis. 

Two alternative pathways - either extrinsic (receptor-mediated) or intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) - lead to apoptotic cell death. The initiation of cell death begins either at the plasma membrane with the binding of TNF or FasL to their cognate receptors or within the cell. The latter is due to the occurrence of intracellular stress in the form of biochemical events such as oxidative stress, redox changes, covalent binding, lipid peroxidation, and consequent functional effects on mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, cytoskeleton, or DNA. The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway involves the initiator, caspase-9, which, when activated, forms an â€œapoptosomeâ€� in the cytosol, together with cytochrome c, which translocates from mitochondria, Apaf-1 and dATP. The apoptosome activates caspase-3, the central effector caspase, which in turn activates downstream factors that are responsible for the apoptotic death of a cell (Fujikawa, 2015). Intracellular stress either directly affects mitochondria or can lead to effects on other organelles, which then send signals to the mitochondria to recruit participation in the death process (Fujikawa, 2015; Malhi et al., 2010). Constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a Ca2+-dependent cytosolic enzyme that forms nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine, and NO reacts with the free radical such as superoxide (O2âˆ’) to form the very toxic free radical peroxynitrite (ONOOâˆ’). Free radicals such as ONOOâˆ’, O2âˆ’ and hydroxyl radical (OHâˆ’) damage cellular membranes and intracellular proteins, enzymes and DNA (Fujikawa, 2015; Kaplowitz, 2002; Kroemer et al., 2009; Malhi et al., 2010).

Necrosis: 

LDH is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme that is present in almost all cells and is released into extracellular space when the plasma membrane is damaged. To detect the leakage of LDH into cell culture medium, a tetrazolium salt is used in this assay. In the first step, LDH produces reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) when it catalyses the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step, a tetrazolium salt is converted to a colored formazan product using newly synthesised NADH in the presence of an electron acceptor. The amount of formazan product can be colorimetrically quantified by standard spectroscopy. Because of the linearity of the assay, it can be used to enumerate the percentage of necrotic cells in a sample (Chan et al., 2013).

The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay for assessing cell viability. NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes may reflect the number of viable cells present. These enzymes are capable of reducing the tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to its insoluble formazan, which has a purple color. Other closely related tetrazolium dyes including XTT, MTS and the WSTs. Tetrazolium dye assays can also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferation to quiescence) of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials. MTT assays are usually done in the dark since the MTT reagent is sensitive to light (Berridge et al., 2005). 

Propidium iodide (PI) is an intercalating agent and a fluorescent molecule used to stain necrotic cells. It is cell membrane impermeant so it stains only those cells where the cell membrane is destroyed. When PI is bound to nucleic acids, the fluorescence excitation maximum is 535 nm and the emission maximum is 617 nm (Moore et al., 1998). 

	Apoptosis: 

TUNEL is a common method for detecting DNA fragmentation that results from apoptotic signalling cascades. The assay relies on the presence of nicks in the DNA which can be identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or TdT, an enzyme that will catalyse the addition of dUTPs that are secondarily labeled with a marker. It may also label cells that have suffered severe DNA damage. 

Caspase activity is measured by fluorescence. During apoptosis, mainly caspase-3 and -7 cleave PARP to yield an 85 kDa and a 25 kDa fragment. PARP cleavage is considered to be one of the classical characteristics of apoptosis. Antibodies to the 85 kDa fragment of cleaved PARP or to caspase-3 both serve as markers for apoptotic cells that can be monitored using immunofluorescence (Li et al., 2004). 

Hoechst 33342 staining: Hoechst dyes are cell-permeable and bind to DNA in live or fixed cells. Therefore, these stains are often called supravital, which means that cells survive a treatment with these compounds. The stained, condensed or fragmented DNA is a marker of apoptosis (Didenko, 2002; Kubbies and Rabinovitch, 1983).

<p>Provide brief description of the (key) event

Biological state: After becoming post-mitotic and during the differentiation process, neuronal cells undergo lengthening, branching, dendrite and dendritic spine formation (Scott and Luo, 2001). In human, dendrites appear as early as 13.5 weeks gestation in the subplate neurons while arborization begins only after 26 weeks (Mrzljak et al., 1988 and Mrzljak et al., 1990). In rodents, during the first postnatal week, both pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons go through extensive and fast dendrite growth, branching, and elaboration. Dendrite arbor's capacity and complexity continue to increase in the second and third postnatal week, however, much slower. During the same developmental window, dendritic spines begin to appear as a group. The first spines look like filopodia (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Fiala et al., 1998). Filopodia can grow and retract within seconds to minutes, permitting them to explore and identify appropriate presynaptic targets (Dailey and Smith, 1996). As dendrite spines mature, these long and thin structures change and the spines shorten and acquire a bulbous ending or â€˜headâ€™ (Dailey and Smith, 1996). At this final stage of dendrite growth, a neuron possesses a dynamic dendrite tree, which has a greater potential for connectivity and synapse creation because of dendritic spine formation. 

Biological compartments: Dendritic morphology determines many aspects of neuronal function, including action potential propagation and information processing. Postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), a protein involved in dendritic spine maturation and clustering of synaptic signalling proteins, plays a critical role in regulating dendrite outgrowth and branching, independent of its synaptic functions. In immature neurons, over-expression of PSD-95 decreases the proportion of primary dendrites that undergo additional branching, resulting in a marked reduction of secondary dendrite number. Conversely, knocking down PSD-95 protein in immature neurons increases secondary dendrite number. Binding of cypin to PSD-95 (that regulates PSD-95 location) correlates with formation of stable dendrite branches. Finally, overexpression of PSD-95 in COS-7 cells disrupts microtubule organization, indicating that PSD-95 may modulate microtubules to regulate dendritic branching. Proteins primarily involved in synaptic functions can also play developmental roles in shaping how a neuron patterns its dendrite branches (Kornau et al., 1995). New spines containing PSDs are formed by conversion of dynamic filopodia-like spine precursors in which PSDs appeared de novo, or by direct extension of spines or spine precursors carrying preformed PSDs from the shaft. PSDs are therefore highly dynamic structures that can undergo rapid structural alteration within dendrite shafts, spines and spine precursors, permitting rapid formation and re-modelling of synaptic connections in developing CNS tissues. 

Dendritic spines are important sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in the strength of these synapses are likely to underlie important higher brain functions such as learning and memory. Spines form biochemical compartments for isolating reactions that occur at one synapse from those at other synapses thereby providing a possible way to ensure the specificity of connections between neurons in the brain. 

The stages of dendrite development have been clearly described in neurons located in the developing rodent cortex and hippocampus (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Fiala et al., 1998; Redmond, 2008) and human prefrontal cortex (Mrzljak et al., 1988; Mrzljak et al., 1990). 

General role in biology: Functionally, dendrites serve as post-synaptic part of a synapse, playing a critical role in the processing of information transmitted through synapses. They receive the majority of synaptic inputs comparing to the soma or the axon. Consequently, it is not surprising that postsynaptic activity is closely related to the properties of the dendritic arbor itself, implying that the dendrites strongly influence and control synaptic transmission and plasticity (SjÃ¶strÃ¶m et al., 2008).

Elaboration of dendritic processes is measured from electron and fluorescent micrographs. These processes are identified primarily by the presence of microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and the absence of components characteristic of axons and glia (e.g. small vesicles, myelin, glial filaments).These measurements can also be carried out by automated imaging systems in cells prepared for immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies that recognise MAP-2 (Harrill and Mundy, 2011). 

Two-photon time-lapse images can be used to visualise dendrites in GFP-transfected neurons, whereas Golgi Stain Kit is used to measure both dendrites and dendritic spines. A combination of Golgi-Cox and immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy has also been suggested for the visualisation of dendrites in brain slices derived either from rodents or non-human primates (Levine et al., 2013). 

The morphological analysis of neurons, include the use of fluorescent markers, such as DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) that permits not only the visualisation of detailed dendritic arborizations and spines in cell culture and tissue sections but also permits the quantitative analysis of dendritic spines (Cheng et al., 2014). 

Fluorescent labelling for MARCM (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) system can also be used but only in case of transparent larval body wall found in Drosophila.

Biological state: Synaptogenesis is a multi-step process that is crucial for brain development and involves the formation of synapses. It follows axonal migration, at which stage presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation occurs (Garner et al., 2002). "Synaptic assembly" that refers to the gathering of the appropriate components and "synaptic formation" that is defined by the mechanisms involved in recruitment of molecules required for differentiation, stabilization and maturation of synapse, are the main phases that characterise synaptogenesis (ColÃ³n-Ramos, 2009). Elimination is a physiological step involved in synaptogenesis regarding the synapses that fail to get stabilised and mature. 

The first step is the recognition and the establishment of contact between an axon and a dendritic spine in which pre- and postsynaptic neurons play important role. The presynaptic differentiation occurs followed by excretion of neurotransmitters that bind to appropriate receptors located on the target spine. However, a postsynaptic neuron does not passively receive guidance from a presynaptic axon but are the same dendritic filopodia that gradually are transformed into spines that select and engage their presynaptic neurons. The transformation of dendritic filopodia into dendritic spines that involves the expression of the whole postsynaptic machinery such as postsynaptic density (PSD), receptor subunits, scaffolding proteins and actin cytoskeleton, is the first step to give nascent synapses. However, to become functional and mature these synapses need an important number of cell-cell interactions, including stimulation from glutamatergic synapses as well as the influence of neurotrophic factors (Munno and Syed, 2003). 

However, all this is true for glutamatergic synapses because GABAergic synapses do not appear in dendritic spines, but rather form on dendritic shafts, nerve cell somata and axon initial segments. These inhibitory synapses besides their distinct location are also structurally different compared to excitatory synapses (reviewed in Gatto and Broadie, 2010). 

Biological compartments: Synaptogenesis is spatially and temporally strictly controlled process. It does not happen in a uniform way in all brain regions and there important differences between the times of appearance of the main two types of synapses (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). For example, in rat hippocampus excitatory synapses are well established or fully mature within the two first postnatal weeks, whereas inhibitory synapses cannot be found prior to PND 18, after which it increases steadily to reach adult levels at PND 28. In addition, in rat neostriatal neurons the excitatory responses to both cortical and thalamic stimuli can be observed by PND 6, but the long-lasting hyperpolarization and late depolarization is never seen before PND 12. 

Structural remodelling of synapses and formation of new synaptic contacts has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of plasticity which is involved in learning and memory. LTP induction results in a sequence of morphological changes consisting of a transient remodelling of the postsynaptic membrane followed by a marked increase in the proportion of axon terminals contacting two or more dendritic spines. Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that these spines arose from the same dendrite. As pharmacological blockade of LTP prevented these morphological changes, it is suggested that LTP is associated with the formation of new, mature and probably functional synapses contacting the same presynaptic terminal and thereby duplicating activated synapses (Erik et al., 2006). 

In human, synaptogenesis does not happen at the same time in all brain regions, as the prefrontal cortex lags behind in terms of synapse formation compared to the auditory and visual cortices. In contrast, synaptogenesis appears to proceed concurrently in different brain areas for rhesus monkey (Erecinska et al., 2004). 

General role in biology: The period of rapid synaptogenesis or the so-called brain growth spurt is considered one of the most important processes that take place during brain development (Garner et al., 2002). This process is crucial not only in neurodevelopment but also plays a vital role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory and adaptation throughout life. Without this process no complex brain network can be established as synapse is the fundamental unit of connectivity and communication between neurons (Tau and Peterson, 2010). Cell adhesion represents the most direct way of coordinating synaptic connectivity in the brain. Recent evidence highlights the importance of a trans-synaptic interaction between postsynaptic neuroligins and presynaptic neurexins. These transmembrane molecules bind each other extracellularly to promote adhesion between dendrites and axons, facilitating synapse establishment (Dean and Dresbach, 2006). Furthermore, the number of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses created at single neuron dictates neuronal excitability and function (Schummers et al., 2002).

There is no OECD advised method for measuring synaptogenesis. 

Anatomical methods can be used to structurally estimate the number of excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Immunostaining can be employed with specific antibodies that recognize vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and the postsynaptic density protein-95 kDa (PSD-95) that are characteristic of excitatory synapses, while inhibitory synapses are identified by the presence of the vesicular GABA (VGAT) and vesicular inhibitory amino acid (VIAAT) transporters and the postsynaptic adaptor protein gephryin (Gatto and Broadie, 2010). There are commercial available synaptogenesis assay kits that rely on the immunostaining of cells with MAP-2, PSD-95 and synaptophysin. Some other presynaptic (Bassoon) and postsynaptic (ProSAP1/Shank2) markers have been suggested and showed to correlate well with the ultrastructural studies in cultured hippocampus primary cells (Grabrucker et al., 2009). Electron microscopy can also be applied to assess the prevalence of excitatory and inhibitory synapses amongst convergent contacts (Megias et al., 2001). Recently, a high content image analysis based on RNAi screening protocols has been suggested as a useful tool to create imaging algorithm for use in both in vitro and in vivo synaptic punctae analysis (Nieland et al., 2014).

Biological state: There are striking differences in neuronal network formation and function among the developing and mature brain. The developing brain shows a slow maturation and a transient passage from spontaneous, long-duration action potentials to synaptically-triggered, short-duration action potentials. 

Furthermore, at this precise developmental stage the neuronal network is characterised by "hyperexcitabilityâ€�, which is related to the increased number of local circuit recurrent excitatory synapses and the lack of Î³-amino-butyric acid A (GABAA)-mediated inhibitory function that appears much later. This â€œhyperexcitabilityâ€� disappears with maturation when pairing of the pre- and postsynaptic partners occurs and synapses are formed generating population of postsynaptic potentials and population of spikes followed by developmental GABA switch. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is dominant at early stages of development and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents are far more times longer than those in maturation, allowing more calcium to enter the neurons. The processes that are involved in increased calcium influx and the subsequent intracellular events seem to play a critical role in establishment of wiring of neural circuits and strengthening of synaptic connections during development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Neurons that do not receive glutaminergic stimulation are undergoing developmental apoptosis. 

During the neonatal period, the brain is subject to profound alterations in neuronal circuitry due to high levels of synaptogenesis and gliogenesis. For example, in neuroendocrine regions such as the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (POA-AH), the site of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) system is developmentally regulated by glutamatergic neurons. The changes in the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B system begin early in postnatal development, before the onset of puberty, thereby playing a role in establishing the appropriate environment for the subsequent maturation of GnRH neurons (Adams et al., 1999). 

Biological compartments: Neural network formation and function happen in all brain regions but it appears to onset at different time points of development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Glutamatergic neurotransmission in hippocampus is poorly developed at birth. Initially, NMDA receptors play important role but the vast majority of these premature glutamatergic synapses are â€œsilentâ€� possibly due to delayed development of hippocampal AMPA receptors. In contrast, in the cerebral cortex the maturation of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission happens much earlier. The â€œsilentâ€� synapses disappear by PND 7-8 in both brain regions mentioned above. 

There is strong evidence suggesting that NMDA receptor subunit composition controls synaptogenesis and synapse stabilization (Gambrill and Barria, 2011). It is established fact that during early postnatal development in the rat hippocampus, synaptogenesis occurs in parallel with a developmental switch in the subunit composition of NMDA receptors from NR2B to NR2A. It is suggested that early expression of NR2A in organotypic hippocampal slices reduces the number of synapses and the volume and dynamics of spines. In contrast, overexpression of NR2B does not affect the normal number and growth of synapses. However, it does increase spine motility, adding and retracting spines at a higher rate. The C terminus of NR2B, and specifically its ability to bind CaMKII, is sufficient to allow proper synapse formation and maturation. Conversely, the C terminus of NR2A was sufficient to stop the development of synapse number and spine growth. These results indicate that the ratio of synaptic NR2B over NR2A controls spine motility and synaptogenesis, and suggest a structural role for the intracellular C terminus of NR2 in recruiting the signalling and scaffolding molecules necessary for proper synaptogenesis. Interestingly, it was found that genetic deletion of NR3A accelerates glutamatergic synaptic transmission, as measured by AMPAR-mediated postsynaptic currents recorded in hippocampal CA1. Consistent, the deletion of NR3A accelerates the expression of the glutamate receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and GluR1 sugesting that glutamatergic synapse maturation is critically dependent upon activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (Henson et al., 2012). 

General role in biology: The development of neuronal networks can be distinguished into two phases: an early â€˜establishmentâ€™ phase of neuronal connections, where activity-dependent and independent mechanisms could operate, and a later â€˜maintenanceâ€™ phase, which appears to be controlled by neuronal activity (Yuste and Sur, 1999). These neuronal networks facilitate information flow that is necessary to produce complex behaviors, including learning and memory (Mayford et al., 2012).

In vivo: The recording of brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potentials (LFP) assists towards the collection of signals generated by multiple neuronal cell networks. Advances in computer technology have allowed quantification of the EEG and expansion of quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis providing a sensitive tool for time-course studies of different compounds acting on neuronal networks' function (Binienda et al., 2011). The number of excitatory or inhibitory synapses can be functionally studied at an electrophysiological level by examining the contribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs. The number of them can be determined by variably clamping the membrane potential and recording excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs or IPSCs) (Liu, 2004). 

In vitro: Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings are also used to measure electrical activity in cultured neurons (Keefer et al., 2001, Gramowski et al., 2000; Gopal, 2003; Johnstone et al., 2010). MEAs can be applied in high throughput platforms to facilitate screening of numerous chemical compounds (McConnell et al., 2012). Using selective agonists and antagonists of different classes of receptors their response can be evaluated in a quantitative manner (Novellino et al., 2011; Hogberg et al., 2011). Patch clamping technique can also be used to measure neuronal network activity.

<p>Provide brief description of the (key) event

Learning can be defined as the process by which new information is acquired to establish knowledge by systematic study or by trial and error (Ono, 2009). Two types of learning are considered in neurobehavioral studies: a) associative learning and b) non-associative learning. 

Associative learning is learning by making associations between different events. In associative learning, a subject learns the relationship among two different stimuli or between the stimulus and the subjectâ€™s behaviour. Classical conditioning, operant conditioning and category learning are some examples of associative learning. On the other hand, non-associative learning can be defined as an alteration in the behavioral response that occurs over time in response to a single type of stimulus. Habituation and sensitization are some examples of non-associative learning. Another important type of learning is emotional learning and the simplest form of emotional regulation is extinction (Quirk and Mueller, 2008). During extinction, conditioned response to a stimulus decreases when the reinforcer is omitted and fear conditioning experiments help to elucidate the underlined mechanism. 

The memory to be formed requires acquisition, retention and retrieval of information in the brain, which is characterised by the non-conscious recall of information (Ono, 2009). Memory is considered very important as it allows the subjects to access the past, to form experience and consequently to acquire skills for surviving purposes. There are three main categories of memory, including sensory memory, short-term or working memory (up to a few hours) and long-term memory (up to several days or even much longer). At the cellular level the storage of long-term memory is associated with increased gene expression and protein synthesis as well as formation of novel synaptic connections (Lynch, 2004). 

Learning-related processes require neural networks to detect correlations between events in the environment and store these as changes in synaptic strength (Abbott and Nelson, 2000). Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two fundamental processes involved in cognitive functions (Abbott and Nelson, 2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004), which respectively, strengthen synaptic inputs that are effective at depolarizing the postsynaptic neuron and weaken inputs that are not, thus reinforcing useful pathways in the brain. Synapses that are strengthened become more effective at depolarizing the postsynaptic neuron, eventually driving neuronal activity to saturation (Abbott and Nelson, 2000). As correlated activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons drives strengthening of specific synapses, the postsynaptic neuron will be driven more strongly, and so presynaptic inputs that were initially only poorly correlated with postsynaptic firing will be better able to trigger firing of the postsynaptic neuron. This implies that nervous systems must have a matching set of plasticity mechanisms that counteract these destabilizing forces. The cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons have a target firing rate, and synaptic strengths are regulated to maintain these rates relatively constant in the face of perturbations in input channel (Burrone et al., 2002). This provides a robust mechanism for generating stability in network function in the face of learning-related changes in synaptic input. In principle, neurons could maintain stable firing rates through homeostatic regulation of many aspects of neuronal excitability. These possibilities include balancing inward and outward voltage-dependent conductances that determine firing properties generally called â€œintrinsic excitabilityâ€� (Marder and Goaillard, 2006; Zhang and Linden 2003), regulating inhibitory and/or excitatory synaptic strength (Turrigiano, 2011) or synapse number (Kirov et al., 1999) or by adjusting the ease with which other forms of plasticity can be induced, so-called â€œmetaplasticityâ€� (Abraham and Bear, 1996). Evidence suggests that all of these mechanisms can contribute to the homeostatic regulation of neuronal firing rates in central circuits. Activity-dependent alteration in synaptic strength is a fundamental property of the vertebrate central nervous system and is thought to underlie learning and memory. 

A major expression mechanism of synaptic scaling is changes in the accumulation of synaptic glutamate receptors. Central synapses typically cluster both AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors. AMPA receptors are ionotropic and carry out the majority of excitatory synaptic current in the central nervous system; NMDA receptors are also ionotropic but open as a function of voltage, flux calcium, and mediate a number of calcium-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity (Malenka and Bear, 2004). Synaptic scaling results in postsynaptic changes in both types of glutamate receptors (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006; Watt et al., 2000) and can therefore be monitored by measuring changes in receptor accumulation at synapses. 

The best characterized form of LTP occurs in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, in which LTP is initiated by transient activation of receptors and is expressed as a persistent increase in synaptic transmission through AMPA receptors followed by activation of NMDARs. This increase is due, at least in part, to a postsynaptic modification of AMPA-receptor function; this modification could be caused by an increase in the number of receptors, their open probability, their kinetics or their single-channel conductance. Summing up activity-dependent alteration in synaptic strength is a fundamental property of the vertebrate central nervous system that underlies learning and memory processes. 

It is appropriate to state that while much emphasis has been given on the key role of the hippocampus in memory, it would probably be simplistic to attribute memory deficits solely to hippocampal damage (Barker and Warburton, 2011). There is substantial evidence that fundamental memory functions are not mediated by hippocampus alone but require a network that includes, in addition to the hippocampus, anterior thalamic nuclei, mammillary bodies cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia (Aggleton and Brown, 1999; Doya, 2000; Mitchell et al., 2002, Toscano and Guilarte, 2005). Each of these brain structures can be potentially damaged leading to more or less severe impairment of learning and memory. 

Amnesia is defined as the impairment or loss of memory. Depending on the cause amnesia can be characterised as functional, organic amnesia or infantile amnesia. Dementia, is a brain disease that causes a long term and often gradual decrease in the ability to think and remember as well as problems with language, and a decrease in motivation (Solomon and Budson, 2011). It is an intellectual impairment observed mainly in elderly people due to the progress of a neudegenerative disease. In younger people this type of impairment is known as presenile dementia. The most common affected areas include memory, visual-spatial, language, attention, and executive function (problem solving). Therefore, very often, short-time memory, mind, speech and motor skills are affected. Certain forms of dementia can be treated, to some extent. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for between 50 and 60 percent of all cases. Other types include vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia (Burns, 2009). Initial symptoms in Alzheimer's disease is memory impairment (for review, Arhavsky, 2010), in particular short-term/episodic memory, which depends largely on hippocampal system (for review, Storandt et al., 2009; Daulatzai, 2013). This pathological and age-related memory decline is believed to be a result of reduced synaptic plasticity, including changes in the NR2 subunit composition of the NMDA receptor (for review, Wang et al., 2014). It can then evolve towards a global loss of cognitive functions defined as dementia (for review, Larson et al., 1992). 

In the past, the study of infant memory has relied in models and tests used in adults and more specific amnesic patients with hippocampal damage. For this reason, the infant memory has been distinguished to declarative or explicit memory and nondeclarative or implicit memory. However, in recent years this distinction such as explicit/implicit are no longer accepted especially in relation to hippocampal function as new theories have been emerged (reviewed in Mullally and Maguire, 2014). Furthermore, there are findings that even very young infants have a more adept and flexible memory system than was previously thought and neurobiological data derived from non-humans provide support to the new hypotheses about hippocampal development that would facilitate to interpret infant memory data from humans. </p>

In humans: The neuropsychological tests have been used for neurosensory assessment of humans including identification of altered neurobehaviours in vulnerable populations such as children (Rohlman et al., 2008). Intelligence tests, perceptual motor tests, planning tests, and logical, spatial, short term, long term, and working memory tasks can be used in neurobehavioral studies to assess learning and memory. The same test is also used to identify risks from occupational exposure to chemicals. 

In laboratory animals: Current behavioural tests used for evaluating learning and memory processes in rats such as the Morris water maze, Radial maze, Passive avoidance and Spontaneous alternation are characterized in the KE Decreased Neuronal Network Function. 

Cognitive function including learning and memory is an important endpoint required by the US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD 426). The methods applied to assess learning and memory have been reviewed (Markis et al., 2009) and discussed in the OECD Series on testing and assessment number 20, Guidance document for Neurotoxicity Testing (2004) . This document is considered an essential supplement to a substantial number of already existing OECD Test Guidelines relevant for neurotoxicity testing.
