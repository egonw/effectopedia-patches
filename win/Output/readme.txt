This is a windows installer for the same release of Effectopedia as in the main folder but wrapped in an windows executable file. The purpose of this version is to provide the benefits of native windows applications like file / shell association, individual process name, automated windows firewall exemptions, java runtime environment detection and installation support and more...

Two versions of Effectopedia are installed Effectopedia.exe and EffectopediaT.exe which are otherwise identical but one (Effectopedia) connects to the production and "EffectopediaT" to the test server.
