Effectopedia can be used offline when connection to Internet is not available and also in case your  
organization does not allow firewall exceptions to be defined for the Effectopedia application (see windows  
install folder for more information on that alternative). In order to use it offline you just need to:

1. Download the latest Effectopedia database revision from the current folder. Two options are available: single aopz file and zipped multi-file representation. 

2. Download the latest Effectopedia.jar file from the parent folder / or alternatively use the windows  
installer.

3. Open the database file from Effectopedia interface as you would do with any other supported file. To open 
the multi file XML representation firt you need to unzip the file in a chosen location and then open aop.xml.

Internet Explorer note! Please be aware that some versions of Internet Explorer are automatically changing  
the database file extension to zip. Please make sure that the database file has the proper aopz extension  
before opening.
