Effectopedia 0.9.22 Alpha version.
This is a version of Effectopedia Adverse Outcome Pathway Editor for evaluation of OECD management groups. Several features in this version are under development and the most recent version can be download from "Alpha 0.9.xx" folder above.  

Main features of Effectopedia 0.9.22 Alpha version include: 
- Search. Accessible trough selection of "Review mechanistic information for individual chemicals" or "Review the current status of existing adverse outcome pathways". Use the first option when you want to search for specific chemical and the second option if you would like to search for a pathway or element of a pathway. In the current version seven sample pathways are available. Type "Example1"..."Example7" to find them. Besides the sample pathways there are growing number of pathways contributed by Effectepedia users. Currently you can use keywords or terms from their titles to find them. From the search results select the name of the pathway you want to load in the viewer.
- Visual pathway editor. This part of the interface allows visualization and editing of pathways. Please use the embedded help system and tutorial to get familiar with the functionality of the interface. The viewer shows given projection of the pathway space which can be changed by right clicking on the axis (with blue labels). Double click on an effect or link to load the editor for this item. All fields in the editor are subject to change and will be system user definable in the future release version of Effectopedia.
- Save and load XML encoded files of Effectopedia pathways. The standard extensions for those files are "aop" and "aopz" for plain and compressed XML files. You can save and load files to your local computer using the respective buttons on the command toolbar of the Visual pathway editor. 
- Support of revision based centralized database. The versioning and revision control system is similar to subversion system. Publishing your local files contents to the centralized database can be achieved with publish button. During the process of evaluation publishing will be temporary disabled. 
- Visual explorer of the edit history. Feature in development which will allow visual comparison of all previous versions of each pathway element. Visual explorer can be used for retrieving old versions of pathway elements and comparing them with the current version. This feature will be further developed as a "smart" redo undo feature both for local actions of individual user and global collaborative edits.
- Discussion and review module. This module is currently under development and currently has only the basic functionality for creating a new topic and posting a reply on existing topic. 
- User registration, login and profile management systems. These features require Internet access and can be controlled from the links in the upper right corner of the Effectopedia application. 
- Notification system is under development and currently allows setting the individual options for users but still does not perform any notifications. 

Known issues in version 0.9.22 Alpha are:
- Visual history explorer does not load the historical version of the pathway elements in the dedicated window
- Discussion posting and topics are stored into the system but could not be shown back to the user once the session is over.
- Singing in after singing out does not work.
